In this project, we developed a “Smart Signal Conditioning System Using Strain Gauge” to accurately measure weight. 
The system utilizes a strain gauge sensor to detect minute deformations caused by applied force, converting mechanical strain into electrical signals.
These signals are processed through a calibrated signal conditioning circuit to produce a readable voltage output. The setup ensures high 
sensitivity and precision in weight measurement, making it suitable for industrial and laboratory applications. The processed data can be visualized
and analyzed using microcontrollers or external systems, offering real-time monitoring and improved measurement reliability
