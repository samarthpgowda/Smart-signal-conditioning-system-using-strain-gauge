Let us find the gain we get from AD620:
Gain=1+Rf/Ri 
Rf= 49.4 kΩ
Ri=470Ω
Gain=1+49400/470
Gain=106.1

Now let us find the strain at V=0.28V:
Let us Vexc at 5V as we are using an Arduino. Now for strain gauge the gauge factor is 2 and gain we have calculated above
Strain=Vout/(Vexc×  GF× G ) 

Where:
	Vout: Output voltage from the amplifier 
	Vexc: Excitation voltage
	GF: Gauge factor 
	G: Amplifier gain 

Strain=0.28/(5× 2× 106.1)
Strain=264 με

Now from this strain let us find the Weight:
First let us find stress:
Stress=Strain×E
Where:
Young’s modulus E=200×109 Pa
Strain=264 με
So, Stress= 200×109 ×264× 10-6
Stress= 52.8× 106 Pa





Now let us find the force from stress:
Force=Stress×Area
For our strain gauge the cross-sectional area=3.902×10-8 m2
Force=52.8× 106 × 3.902×10-8
Force= 2.06 N

Now let us calculate the weight from force:
Weight (kg)=Force/g
Where g=9.8 m/s²
Weight=2.06/9.8
Weight=0.21 kg
